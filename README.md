MotorolaTask

Good day to you all! First of all, I would like to explain myself a little.
I have decided to attend this recruitment process even though I do not have a
background in coding. I would like to learn as much as possible and I believe that this Motorola
project is a great opportunity for me.
However, when I received the task, I realized that I am lacking the skill - I do not have
much experience in programming. Therefore I did plan on my own what I would like the solution
to be, but to proceed with the programme, I asked my colleague for help.
As such, I would like you to know that even though the solution was mine, I did not finish
this task solely on my own.
As mentioned, I would love to participate in the Motorola Academy - but I am not sure, if
with my lack of experience it will be possible for me to join it. I was convinced that
this project was meant for people with no IT background - this is why due to the fact that
I had to ask my friend for help with the coding made me realize that my skills might be
not enough.
As such, I wanted to be clear about this work, because I needed external help to finish it.
